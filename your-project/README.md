## Project Description
:books: Books for Buddies :books: is an application created to help avid readers find exciting readings based on their own tastes and interests, as well as to give as gifts to their friends and loved ones. That is why we have created a dynamic environment that will help you choose your preferences and will give you results very in line with what you were looking for, giving you information such as the title, author and price of the book.

If you want to read a good book, or perhaps give it as a gift, we will help you choose the right one!  :feet: :dart:

## Hypotheses / Questions
Efficiency and Accuracy of Data Retrieval:

We hypothesize that by combining API integration and web scraping techniques, our application enhances the efficiency and accuracy of extracting book information, including author details, page count, book title, category, and price.
Comparison of Data Sources:

We aim to explore and compare the data obtained from the API with that acquired through web scraping. Our hypothesis is that this dual approach allows for a more comprehensive and enriched dataset, contributing to a more robust user experience.
User Interaction and Customization:

We anticipate that the web interface provides users with an interactive and customizable experience. The hypothesis is that users can easily tailor their searches, filtering books based on specific criteria and preferences.
Data Consistency and Reliability:

We seek to evaluate the consistency and reliability of the extracted data from both the API and web scraping. Our assumption is that the combination of these methods ensures a higher degree of data reliability, reducing the risk of missing or incomplete information.
Scalability and Maintenance:

## Organization
We have been three people working on the project, brainstorming ideas collectively and shaping them. Later on, some of us focused on the APIs and web scraping, while others concentrated on web development, usability, and documentation.  

To organize ourselves and keep track of tasks, we have used Trello for assistance.
